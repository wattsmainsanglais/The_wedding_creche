      <h1> FAQ's</h1>
        <article class="faq-question">
          <h2>Why a wedding crèche?</h2>
          <p>A wedding is a special day to celebrate your love with those you love. It’s a time to let your hair down, relax and enjoy yourself after all the hard work that has gone into the planning. Some parts of the day, although beautiful, can feel tiring for little ones- that’s where we come in. We arrive and create a beautiful, peaceful and fun environment for children of all ages to enjoy. Every element is thought about, from activities, toys and games to spare clothes, nappies and snacks to a cosy place for story times and naps, let your guests take a breath knowing we’ve got it all covered to make their day easier. You can relax knowing that when it comes to your little guests, we have it all in hand.</p>

        <article class="faq-question">
          <h2>What can we offer?</h2>
          <p>We are happy to discuss how you’d like your day to flow and can work with you to facilitate this. We can offer full day crèches, crèches at specific days (for example to keep little ones occupied during the ceremony or speeches) or we can create drop-in family spaces for children and parents alike to enjoy and make use of throughout your event. This can offer a quiet corner for nap times, breastfeeding or if children need a breather if overstimulated. In addition, we can create hand-made activity packs for children to enjoy throughout the day. As the evening draws in you may want to make use of our babysitting and pyjama party packages. We can give you peace of mind by being there to look after your little ones as you get ready for the big day, throughout rehearsal dinners, on the day itself and in the day(s) that follow. We are happy to discuss what would best suit you.</p>
