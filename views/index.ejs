      <article class="review review-two">
        <p>Sinead joined us over a long weekend at my sister’s wedding in France. She had sole charge of our 8 month old son for the entirety of the weekend and was brilliant with him - he took to her immediately and was enthralled by her singing, stories and games. She even brought books and toys with her! 
          As my sister’s maid of honour, it was wonderful to be able to focus on her special time and know that our son was in good hands. Sinead was flexible when we made last minute changes to events, personable with guests and diligent in her duty of care. </p>

            <h2 class="slide-one">Why a wedding crèche?</h2>
            <p class="slide-two">A wedding is a special day to celebrate your love with those you love. It’s a time to let your hair down, relax and enjoy yourself after all the hard work that has gone into the planning. Some parts of the day, although beautiful, can feel tiring for little ones- that’s where we come in. We arrive and create a beautiful, peaceful and fun environment for children of all ages to enjoy. Every element is thought about, from activities, toys and games to spare clothes, nappies and snacks to a cosy place for story times and naps, let your guests take a breath knowing we’ve got it all covered to make their day easier. You can relax knowing that when it comes to your little guests, we have it all in hand.</p>

          <article class="faq-question two">
            <h2 class="slide-one">What can we offer?</h2>
            <p class="slide-two">We are happy to discuss how you’d like your day to flow and can work with you to facilitate this. We can offer full day crèches, crèches at specific days (for example to keep little ones occupied during the ceremony or speeches) or we can create drop-in family spaces for children and parents alike to enjoy and make use of throughout your event. This can offer a quiet corner for nap times, breastfeeding or if children need a breather if overstimulated. In addition, we can create hand-made activity packs for children to enjoy throughout the day. As the evening draws in you may want to make use of our babysitting and pyjama party packages. We can give you peace of mind by being there to look after your little ones as you get ready for the big day, throughout rehearsal dinners, on the day itself and in the day(s) that follow. We are happy to discuss what would best suit you.</p>

            <h2 class="slide-one">What about holidays?</h2>
            <p class="slide-two">Whether a special holiday like a honeymoon or a much-needed family getaway you deserve to switch off while on holiday and feel as rested as possible after you return. Allow us to take the planning and organisation out of your holiday by offering engaging activities to your children while you relax. We can accompany you on every step of your trip or at specific moments to allow you time by the pool or a day out as adults. Share a romantic meal while we offer evening wind-downs, baby-sitting for little ones and pyjama parties for bigger ones.</p>

          <article class="faq-question four">

            <p class="slide-two">We are safeguarding and first aid trained and are fully insured, and DBS checked. In planning for your event, we will take information from you such as allergies and additional needs to ensure that we take the best care of each child. The pop-up crèche is full of beautiful toys, specially chosen to enchant your little ones. We will take information from you about the age and interests of your little guests, and you can leave the rest to us, everything we do will be tailored to them. We request a minimum booking of 4 hours per event and a 50% deposit in order to reserve your date, however this is fully refundable up to 14 days before the event date in case of cancellation. Contact us for a free, no obligation consultation to discuss your bespoke package, we look forward to meeting you!</p>
